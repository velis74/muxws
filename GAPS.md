# Gaps

Every place a brief is silent, ambiguous, self-contradictory, or contradicted by the specification,
plus every deliberate deviation from a brief's literal text. One entry per problem, newest last.

## muxws-m0-scaffolding.md — WSM-PKG-001, WSM-PKG-003

**What I needed:** the distribution name for both packages.

**What the brief says:** `dynamicforms-wsmux` on PyPI and `@dynamicforms/wsmux` on npm, with the
Python import package `wsmux/`.

**What I assumed:** neither. The author decided the library is not a DynamicForms component - it has
nothing to do with forms - and must stand on its own name. `wsmux` was unavailable on PyPI (taken by
an unrelated workspace-launcher CLI whose wheel ships a colliding `wsmux/` module), so the name is
**`muxws`**, one word, everywhere: PyPI `muxws`, npm `muxws`, Python package `muxws/`, environment
variables `MUXWS_CODEC` / `VITE_MUXWS_CODEC`, loggers `muxws.frames` / `muxws.codec`, root exception
`MuxwsError`, and the wire subprotocol `muxws.v1.<codec>`. The whole of `docs/design/` was renamed
mechanically to match; the `WSM-*` rule ids were deliberately left untouched, because the briefs make
them the stable contract between milestones.

## muxws-m0-scaffolding.md — no rule id

**What I needed:** to know whether `docs/design/` is part of the published documentation site.

**What the brief says:** nothing. Its `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` was written for a `docs/` workspace
that contained only `index.md`, `guide/` and `api/`, because in the original design repository the
briefs lived somewhere else entirely.

**What I assumed:** it is not. The author confirmed the design material is a record of how muxws was
designed, not documentation of how to use it. `srcExclude: ['design/**']` keeps it out of the build.
This also disposes of a problem M7 would otherwise have hit: `docs/design/README.md` still carries 16
links to backchannel briefs that do not exist in this repository, and M7 requires the VitePress build
to treat dead links as fatal.

## muxws-m0-scaffolding.md — no rule id

**What I needed:** a CI job for the Node side that survives a fresh checkout.

**What the brief says:** two things that cannot both hold. Its `.gitignore` (§5) ignores
`/package-lock.json`, and its CI description (§5) runs `npm ci` - which fails outright when no
lockfile is present, which on a fresh clone is always.

**What I assumed:** nothing, in the end - the author decided. The `.gitignore` half stands and CI
runs `npm install`. The reason is not that a lockfile is unwanted in principle but that resolving
afresh is *what CI is for* at this stage: it tests the newest dependency tree against the pinned one
sitting on the development machine, so upstream breakage surfaces on the day it happens instead of
whenever someone next regenerates the lock. A committed lockfile is a deployment posture, not a
development one. Worth revisiting at 1.0, when reproducibility starts to matter more than early
warning.
